# Introduction

This directory contains all of the tests for this project.  This documentation is designed to make clear things that would otherwise be unclear.

## Unit

All unit tests are written using the [mocha](https://mochajs.org) framework, and run using ```npm run test``` during automated or manual test.

Triggered: Every commit pushed to central repository.

Best practices:

- Create a separate ```*Tests.js``` for each source file being tested.
- Use a standard mocker:  Prefer [sinon](https://sinonjs.org) for all mocks and [nock](https://github.com/nock/nock) for HTTP mocks. 
- Monitor and enforce coverage, but avoid writing tests simply to increase coverage when there is no other perceived value.
- With that being said, **enforce coverage** in automated test.
