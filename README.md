# Welcome to f5-conx-core

f5-conx-core is a project to abstract all the API functionality developed for the vscode-f5 extension to be used in other projects.

This project is based on JavaScript, but written in TypeScript and utilizes JSdoc to provide built in documentation of functionality, inputs, and outputs.

Goals/features:

* standardize all F5 HTTP REST calls
  * auth token/provider management
  * standard async/job monitoring
  * provide connection timing information for analytics/telemtry
  * file upload/download functionality
  * tmos meta data and ATC service discovery/mgmt
  * ATC version mgmt (from github)
  * ATC RPM install/uninstall
  * ATC usage (fast/as3/do/ts/cf)
  * UCS/QKVIEW management
* standardize all external HTTP rest calls
  * custom user-agent to identify calls made with this project
  * file downloads
  * internet proxy support (pending/in-progress)
* IPv6 support (pending/in-progress)
* standard file cache location
* standard logging functionality

## Architecture

### http-timer for axios requests

<https://github.com/szmarczak/http-timer>

The above plugin adds the following timings object to the response of axios

```typescript
export interface Timings {
    start: number;
    socket?: number;
    lookup?: number;
    connect?: number;
    secureConnect?: number;
    upload?: number;
    response?: number;
    end?: number;
    error?: number;
    abort?: number;
    phases: {
        wait?: number;
        dns?: number;
        tcp?: number;
        tls?: number;
        request?: number;
        firstByte?: number;
        download?: number;
        total?: number;
    };
}
```

### simplified HTTP Response type including the timings

```typescript
export type HttpResponse = {
    data?: unknown;
    headers?: unknown;
    status: number;
    statusText?: string;
    request?: {
        url: string;
        method: string;
        headers: unknown;
        protocol: string;
        timings: Timings;
        data?: unknown;
    };
};
```

Using these timings we can log and provide stats about what devices (mainly f5) are responding slower than others or a gathered base line (telemetry/analytics)

## Usage

**Add details about how to use the project**

## Contributor Documentation

A collection of helpful commands have been added to the package manager (npm) scripts directive. Check out the `package.json` for an up-to-date list of commands.

* Build Package (Typescript -> Javascript): `npm run build-package`
* Build Code Documentation: `npm run build-code-docs`
* Run Unit Tests: `npm run test`
* Run Linter: `npm run lint`

Note that the `main` and `types` package manager directive are pointed at the `dist` folder (where `tsc` builds the package). Please ensure any published packages builds and includes that folder.
